# LearningLog — Practice Project (HTML, Python, JavaScript)

Status: ARCHIVED (read-only)  
Archived on: 2025-11-17

This repository is an initial practice project created to record small learning experiments and examples across HTML, Python, and a bit of JavaScript. It was built as a learning exercise and is being archived for future reference.

Description
- A small collection of practice files and experiments made while learning web basics and Python scripting.
- Purpose: personal learning and experimentation — not production-ready.

Language composition
- HTML: 46.0%  
- Python: 44.7%  
- JavaScript: 7.7%  
- Other: 1.6%

What you'll find here (typical)
- HTML files and simple static pages (open in a browser).
- Python scripts used for practice or small tooling examples.
- Small JavaScript snippets for client-side behavior.
- Notes, examples, or markdown documents describing learning progress.

How to view locally
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Divesh-Kshirsagar/LearningLog.git
2. For static HTML pages: open index.html (or other .html files) in your browser.
3. To serve static files from a simple local server:
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   then open http://localhost:8000
4. For Python scripts: inspect the script(s) and run with:
   python3 path/to/script.py
   (Check any script headers/comments for required versions or dependencies.)

What I learned
- Basic HTML structure and simple page layout.
- Writing and running small Python scripts for practice.
- Adding simple client-side interactivity with JavaScript.
- Organizing small practice projects and keeping notes for future reference.

Notes
- This repository is intentionally minimal and was created for practice.
- No build system or package manager is required for the basic examples.
- No LICENSE file is included — add one if you want to reuse or redistribute the code.
